MEAN Stack

My attempt at exploring/learning front end development through MEAN stack technologies of AngularJs, Express, NodeJS and MongoDB. Along the way have been exploring Browser-sync, MongoJS, Bootstrap, CSS3, HTML5, Sublime Text, and host of other modern day technologies enabling rich SPA development.
